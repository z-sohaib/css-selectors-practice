# CSS Selectors Practice

In this assignment, you have an HTML file and you're asked to do some extra styles to make it look more fancy.
Here are the tasks to do:

- Select the header element and apply styles with a background color and text color. For example, use a background color of light blue and a text color of white.
- Use the class selector to style the paragraph with the class "special" with a background color and text color. For example, use a background color of yellow and a text color of navy.
- Apply styles to the element with the ID "footer" using the ID selector with a background color and text color. For example, use a background color of dark green and a text color of white.
- Target the list items within the navigation element and style them with a background color and text color. For example, use a background color of light gray (#f2f2f2) and a text color of dark gray (#333).
- Apply styles to the list items within the navigation element to change their appearance when hovered over with a background color and text color. For example, use a background color of light gray (#ddd) and a text color of medium gray (#555).

Note: Write your CSS code within a separate file named **styles.css.** Ensure to link the styles.css file to your HTML document using the link tag in the head section.
